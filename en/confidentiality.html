                <h1>Privacy and Cookie Policy</h1>
                <p>Published on November 5, 2021.</p>
                <h2>1. Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>iText LLP, registered under the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan, observes and protects the privacy
                    of users of the site with the domain itext.agency, making every possible and proportional effort not
                    to violate their rights.</p>
                <p>This privacy policy aims to explain to users the procedures iText LLP uses to protect their data,
                    namely, what personal data is collected, why it is collected, how it is used, how it is covered, and
                    what rights the user has.</p>
                <p>This privacy policy does not cover our responsibility to protect third parties data, information, or
                    other activities, including those who operate the sites or services to which itext.agency links.</p>
                <p>This privacy policy applies to all personal data that iText LLP acquires or processes when users
                    interact with itext.agency website. This includes buying and using our services, responding to
                    marketing messages, and contacting iText LLP customer support. These interactions may relate to
                    visitors, customers, suppliers, and/or partners.</p>
                <p>In addition, iText LLP processes personal data obtained from sources other than the itext.agency
                    website, for which a different privacy policy is required.</p>
                <h2>2. General information about data processing</h2>
                <p>Throughout this Privacy Policy, the term &quot;personal information&quot; means information that
                    identifies users. It allows us to identify users directly or in combination with other information
                    at our disposal.</p>
                <h3><strong>Site users in general</strong></h3>
                <p>iText LLP processes user data based on consent. By using or visiting the iText LLP website, users
                    explicitly accept this privacy policy and consent to processing their personal data for the purposes
                    and methods described below, including disclosure to third parties if necessary to provide the
                    service. Providing data and consent to its collection and processing is not mandatory. The user may
                    refuse permission and withdraw consent at any time. However, denying permission may make it
                    impossible to provide some services and adversely affect the site&#39;s navigation.</p>
                <h3><strong>Clients</strong></h3>
                <p>iText LLP undertakes to do everything possible to ensure maximum confidentiality in providing
                    services, as far as the electronic form of the service is concerned. All texts, the nature of the
                    work performed, personal data of the client transmitted for translation purposes, and any
                    information transmitted by the client to iText LLP are strictly confidential, and the personal data
                    obtained is processed under Article 6 of the GDPR.</p>
                <p>In particular, iText LLP uses the provided information only for contract execution (and for possible
                    pre-contractual operations) and may not - without the prior written consent of the customer -
                    publicly disclose or transfer such information to third parties, except to authorized employees or
                    suppliers, if their operational or consulting intervention requires access to such information. The
                    above guarantees do not apply if iText LLP undertakes to disclose such information as required by
                    law or if such information is or will be in the public domain regardless of its disclosure by iText
                    LLP. The same applies when the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require
                    the processing of personal data or when processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests
                    of iText LLP or third parties whose importance is greater than the rights of the data subject.</p>
                <h3><strong>Suppliers and employees</strong></h3>
                <p>The personal information of our suppliers and freelancers (suppliers, interpreters, translators,
                    graphic designers, partner organizations, consultants, etc.) is treated with the utmost
                    confidentiality. The only information that is shared with third parties is the information posted on
                    our site: your username, your native language, experience, and education. Other information,
                    including full name, date of birth, addresses, and telephone numbers, is used only by iText LLP and
                    its authorized vendors (e.g., accounting firms, banks, etc.) for purposes related to current
                    operations.</p>
                <h2>3. Automatically collected information. Webview data</h2>
                <p>Like all Web sites, this site also uses log files that automatically collect and store information
                    about user visits. The information collected may include the following:</p>
                <ul role="list">
                    <li>your IP address</li>
                    <li>the type of browser and parameters of the device used to connect to the site</li>
                    <li>the name of the Internet Service Provider (ISP)</li>
                    <li>the date and time of the visit/request</li>
                    <li>the number of clicks, where possible</li>
                    <li>method used to send the request to the server</li>
                    <li>the size of the file received in response</li>
                    <li>a numeric code indicating the status of the response from the server</li>
                    <li>Other parameters related to the operating system and the user&#39;s IT environment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The information above is processed automatically and is only collected in aggregate form to ensure
                    the proper functioning of the site and for security reasons. For security purposes (spam filters,
                    firewalls, virus detection), automatically logged data may also include personal information, such
                    as the IP address (which uniquely identifies a computer at a given time), which can be used - under
                    current legislation governing this matter - to block attempts to harm the site or other users, to
                    commit malicious and criminal acts. This type of data is used to protect the site and its users.</p>
                <p>The data listed is used for the sole purpose of obtaining anonymous statistical information about the
                    use of the site and to verify its proper functioning. Consequently, the data is deleted immediately
                    after processing. Data used for security purposes (blocking attempts to harm the site) is stored for
                    seven days.</p>
                <h2>4. Use of cookies</h2>
                <h3><strong>What are cookies.</strong></h3>
                <p>A cookie is a small text file sent to your browser from a website you visit and then stored on your
                    computer&#39;s hard drive. If you reconnect to this site, the cookies are re-read and recognized by
                    the site that sent them. When you visit a website, you may receive cookies from third-party sites
                    (called &quot;third-party cookies&quot;), such as links to web pages on other domains.</p>
                <p>Cookies can be used for various purposes, such as recognizing a user&#39;s device by the website,
                    tracking sessions, and remembering specific information about users who access the server.</p>
                <h3><strong>Types of cookies</strong></h3>
                <p>Technical cookies are necessary for the proper functioning of the site and for you to benefit from
                    its services.</p>
                <p>Functionality cookies make it easier for you to navigate the site, remember your selections, and
                    tailor the functionality to your requirements.</p>
                <p>The site uses analytics cookies to collect information about the site&#39;s use, visited pages, and
                    any errors that may occur while browsing. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable
                    information about your computer. All information collected by such cookies is combined into a single
                    array and, therefore, anonymous.</p>
                <p>However, the user can disable analytics cookies anytime by using the instructions below.</p>
                <h3><strong>Disabling cookies</strong></h3>
                <p>You can allow or disallow cookies anytime and erase any installed cookies by adjusting your browser
                    settings. The company cannot guarantee the site&#39;s proper operation if cookies are disabled.</p>
                <p>The procedure for adjusting settings differs depending on the browser. </p>
                <h2>5. Third-party files of a cookie</h2>
                <p>This site also acts as an intermediary for third-party cookies, which are used to provide additional
                    services and features to users. They also enhance the site&#39;s user interface with buttons for
                    social media or video. This site has no access to or control over third-party cookies - they are
                    managed entirely by third parties. As a consequence, information about the use of these cookies and
                    their purposes, as well as how to disable them, is provided directly by third parties on the pages
                    listed below.</p>
                <h3><strong>Social Networks</strong></h3>
                <p>This site also includes plugins and/or social media buttons to provide easy access to content on your
                    favorite social networks. These plugins are programmed not to set cookies to protect your privacy.
                    The cookies can only be installed if provided by social media when you explicitly use the plugin of
                    your own volition. Please note: If you browse the website by logging into a social network, you had
                    already consented to the use of cookies sent through this site when you registered for the social
                    network.</p>
                <p>The collection and use of data obtained through plug-ins is governed by the relevant social media
                    privacy policies.</p>
                <h2>6. Mailing lists and emails</h2>
                <p>They may contain a confirmation of orders or subscriptions to the newsletter. In correspondence with
                    you, we may also provide you with information about iText LLP services. In addition, in the case of
                    newsletters, we record (for example, with the help of the so-called &quot;tracking pixel&quot;) that
                    the email has been read and the links contained therein have been clicked. This allows us to
                    optimize our offerings and tailor them to your needs. Thanks to this data, we can send you the news
                    that will interest you personally.</p>
                <p>You can decline these types of processing at www.itext.agency. For example, you can change your
                    online profile or unsubscribe from our newsletter, and you can contact the data controller at the
                    address below.</p>
                <h2>7. Place of data processing</h2>
                <p>The data collected by this site is processed at the data controller&#39;s main office and the web
                    data center. GitHub Pages, responsible for data processing and handling data on behalf of the data
                    controller, is located in the European Economic Area and operates under European standards.</p>
                <h2>8. Data transmission in non-EU countries</h2>
                <p>This site may transfer some collected data to servers outside the European Union. Specifically
                    through Google, Facebook, and Microsoft (LinkedIn) through social plugins and Google Analytics. The
                    transfer is permitted based on specific European Union and Guarantor regulations on protecting
                    personal data, particularly Regulation 1250/2016 (Data Privacy Protector), for which no additional
                    consent is required. The companies mentioned above guarantee compliance with the provisions of the
                    Data Privacy Shield.</p>
                <h2>9. Precautions</h2>
                <p>This site processes your data according to the law and with appropriate security measures to prevent
                    unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction. We process your data using a computer
                    and/or electronic tools, applying the appropriate organizational, technical, and administrative
                    measures to protect personal data using criteria strictly related to the stated purposes.
                    Unfortunately, no data transfer tool and no storage system can guarantee 100% data integrity. Please
                    get in touch with us if you feel that your data transmitted to us while using the site is not
                    sufficiently protected.</p>
                <p>In addition to the data controller, in some cases, access to stored personal data may be granted to
                    other parties involved in the site (administration, sales, legal, and system administrators) or to
                    other companies (such as third-party tech support providers, courier companies, hosting providers,
                    IT companies and communications agencies), which, if necessary, may be assigned by the data
                    controller to process personal data.</p>
                <p>Your personal information should be kept for as long as necessary or permitted in light of the
                    purposes for which it is collected. The criteria adopted for determining retention periods are as
                    follows: (i) the period of regular use of itext.agency; (ii) the need for us to fulfill a contract
                    or legal obligation; (iii) the ability to retain data in light of our legal position (for example,
                    concerning deadlines, disputes, or regulatory compliance checks).</p>
                <h2>10. User rights</h2>
                <p>Under the GDPR and Kazakh law, in the manner and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you have
                    the following rights concerning your personal data:</p>
                <ul role="list">

                    <li>know the source from which they were obtained</li>
                    <li>get a clear explanation</li>
                    <li>obtain information about the criteria, methods, and purposes of processing</li>
                    <li>request an update, correction, integration, cancellation, conversion into anonymous form,
                        blocking of data processed in violation of the law, including when it is no longer needed to
                        achieve the purposes for which it was obtained</li>
                    <li>in the case of consent-based processing, obtain any reference to the data that has been provided
                        to the data controller in a structured and readable form, completed by the data processor, and
                        in a format normally available on electronic devices</li>
                    <li>the right to file a complaint with the supervisory authorities</li>
                    <li>as well as, in general, to exercise all rights that are recognized by applicable law</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Requests must be addressed to the data controller. In particular, you can exercise your rights
                    regarding processing personal data by contacting www.itext.agency, for example, by changing your
