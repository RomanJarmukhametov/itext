                <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                <h2><strong>Our warranty</strong></h2>
                <p>If you are not satisfied with the quality of the translation, we will provide you with a new version
                    as soon as possible and at our expense. If the second version also proves unacceptable, you will be
                    entitled to a full or partial refund. The conditions and procedures for challenging work performed
                    are listed below.</p>
                <p>In case of untimely delivery of work, if the time of delay expressed in working days exceeds the
                    general term of translation performance by more than one-third (i.e., with 33% delay), and if such
                    delay is exclusively the fault of iText LLP, we undertake to compensate up to 100% of the
                    translation cost.</p>
                <h2>General terms of sale</h2>
                <p>These general terms and conditions of sale apply to all work assignments performed by iText LLP. </p>
                <p>All translation requests must be accompanied by an order indicating the price set by the parties.
                    Orders may be sent by regular mail, e-mail or fax; we reserve the right to refuse work without
                    receiving the order.</p>
                <p>If technical documentation is involved, the client should provide reference materials and/or drawings
                    or diagrams to ensure a better understanding of such documents.</p>
                <p>The cost of the translation is calculated based on the number of words in the original language
                    unless another form of evaluation has been agreed upon in advance in writing.</p>
                <p>If a customer cancels an order, we bill 100% of the cost for all work performed and 50% for suspended
                    work.</p>
                <p>Unless otherwise agreed, all invoices are due and payable within five days of the invoice date.</p>
                <p>Any delay in payment or non-payment of an invoice is cause for immediate collection from the customer
                    without prior notice or other formalities. iText LLP reserves the right to demand payment of
                    interest calculated at the official discount rate of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan
                    in effect at the time of overdue payment. In addition, the customer must reimburse all costs
                    incurred by iText LLP. </p>
                <p>If payment is delayed, all work in progress and ongoing orders are suspended.</p>
                <p>iText LLP will not be responsible for translations that, for whatever reason, are not satisfactory in
                    terms of style. In particular, concerning advertising and sales promotion materials, iText LLP&#39;s
                    services are limited to simple translation unless otherwise expressly requested in the application.
                    iText LLP is not responsible for the transposition of the translated text, for example, in
                    advertising style, which differs from the style of the source text. Our liability is limited only to
                    the amount of the bill.</p>
                <p>Claims will only be accepted if received by registered mail with the paid delivery notice within
                    seven days of delivery of the work(s) or part of the work(s). Original documents, disputed
                    translations, and a letter of explanation must accompany all claims. After the above period, the
                    translation will be regarded as correct.</p>
                <p>If the claim of the dissatisfied customer is submitted within the established deadlines, iText LLP
                    agrees to provide the edited version of the disputed translation at its own expense within the term
                    equal to one-third of the term previously established for this work, plus one business day. This
                    second document will be used to assess the quality of translation in establishing the amount of
                    compensation payable at the discretion of iText LLP. </p>
                <p>iText LLP is not responsible for any delays caused by malfunctioning faxes, modems, e-mail and/or
                    other postal services or carriers not directly controlled by iText LLP. </p>
                <p>In case of late delivery of work, if the time of delay exceeds the deadline by more than one-third,
                    and if such delay is directly and solely due to the fault of iText LLP, we will reimburse the cost,
                    which will be set by agreement between the parties, it can amount up to 100% of the cost of work
                    delivered with a delay.</p>
                <p>Flaws in one part of the work are not grounds for a claim. iText LLP reserves the right to change the
                    translation in such cases.</p>
                <p>Only written agreements between the parties will be taken into account. Any disputes and
                    disagreements are within the jurisdiction of the Pavlodar Court. In the event of non-payment,
                    submitting a partial or complete reproduction of the translation in question will be deemed illegal.
                    iText LLP reserves the right to demand immediate payment for translation and compensation for
                    copyright infringement in appropriate cases from the customer who uses unpaid materials.</p>
                <h2>Responsibility</h2>
                <p>iText LLP and/or its suppliers disclaim any warranties or conditions relating to the services
                    offered, including any implied warranties and conditions regarding merchantability, fitness for a
                    particular purpose, proprietary rights, and non-infringement of the rights of others. iText LLP and
                    its suppliers shall not be liable, for any reason whatsoever, for any direct, indirect, or
                    consequential losses or damages resulting from loss of use rights, loss of information, or damages
                    resulting from the performance or non-performance of a contract, negligence or other malicious acts
                    in any way related to iText LLP services. </p>
