                    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                    <h2><strong>Our warranty</strong></h2>
                    <p>If you are not satisfied with the quality of the translation, we will provide you with a new
                        version
                        as soon as possible and at our expense. If the second version also proves unacceptable, you will
                        be
                        entitled to a full or partial refund. The conditions and procedures for challenging work
                        performed
                        are listed below.</p>
                    <p>In case of untimely delivery of work, if the time of delay expressed in working days exceeds the
                        general term of translation performance by more than one-third (i.e., with 33% delay), and if
                        such
                        delay is exclusively the fault of iText LLP, we undertake to compensate up to 100% of the
                        translation cost.</p>
                    <h2>General terms of sale</h2>
                    <p>These general terms and conditions of sale apply to all work assignments performed by iText LLP.
                    </p>
                    <p>All translation requests must be accompanied by an order indicating the price set by the parties.
                        Orders may be sent by regular mail, e-mail or fax; we reserve the right to refuse work without
                        receiving the order.</p>
                    <p>If technical documentation is involved, the client should provide reference materials and/or
                        drawings
                        or diagrams to ensure a better understanding of such documents.</p>
                    <p>The cost of the translation is calculated based on the number of words in the original language
                        unless another form of evaluation has been agreed upon in advance in writing.</p>
                    <p>If a customer cancels an order, we bill 100% of the cost for all work performed and 50% for
                        suspended
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Unless otherwise agreed, all invoices are due and payable within five days of the invoice date.
                    </p>
                    <p>Any delay in payment or non-payment of an invoice is cause for immediate collection from the
                        customer
                        without prior notice or other formalities. iText LLP reserves the right to demand payment of
                        interest calculated at the official discount rate of the National Bank of the Republic of
                        Kazakhstan
                        in effect at the time of overdue payment. In addition, the customer must reimburse all costs
                        incurred by iText LLP. </p>
                    <p>If payment is delayed, all work in progress and ongoing orders are suspended.</p>
                    <p>iText LLP will not be responsible for translations that, for whatever reason, are not
                        satisfactory in
                        terms of style. In particular, concerning advertising and sales promotion materials, iText
                        LLP&#39;s
                        services are limited to simple translation unless otherwise expressly requested in the
                        application.
                        iText LLP is not responsible for the transposition of the translated text, for example, in
                        advertising style, which differs from the style of the source text. Our liability is limited
                        only to
                        the amount of the bill.</p>
                    <p>Claims will only be accepted if received by registered mail with the paid delivery notice within
                        seven days of delivery of the work(s) or part of the work(s). Original documents, disputed
                        translations, and a letter of explanation must accompany all claims. After the above period, the
                        translation will be regarded as correct.</p>
                    <p>If the claim of the dissatisfied customer is submitted within the established deadlines, iText
                        LLP
                        agrees to provide the edited version of the disputed translation at its own expense within the
                        term
                        equal to one-third of the term previously established for this work, plus one business day. This
                        second document will be used to assess the quality of translation in establishing the amount of
                        compensation payable at the discretion of iText LLP. </p>
                    <p>iText LLP is not responsible for any delays caused by malfunctioning faxes, modems, e-mail and/or
                        other postal services or carriers not directly controlled by iText LLP. </p>
                    <p>In case of late delivery of work, if the time of delay exceeds the deadline by more than
                        one-third,
                        and if such delay is directly and solely due to the fault of iText LLP, we will reimburse the
                        cost,
                        which will be set by agreement between the parties, it can amount up to 100% of the cost of work
                        delivered with a delay.</p>
                    <p>Flaws in one part of the work are not grounds for a claim. iText LLP reserves the right to change
                        the
                        translation in such cases.</p>
                    <p>Only written agreements between the parties will be taken into account. Any disputes and
                        disagreements are within the jurisdiction of the Pavlodar Court. In the event of non-payment,
                        submitting a partial or complete reproduction of the translation in question will be deemed
                        illegal.
                        iText LLP reserves the right to demand immediate payment for translation and compensation for
                        copyright infringement in appropriate cases from the customer who uses unpaid materials.</p>
